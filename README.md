# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

Compiling contract `npx hardhat compile`\
Deploying contracts ROPSTEN `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js`\
Deploying contracts localhost `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`\
Connecting a wallet `npx hardhat node`

### Run tasks on localhost 
donate ` npx hardhat donate --amount 1000 --network localhost`\
get balance `npx hardhat balance --network localhost`\
withdraws `npx hardhat withdraw --account address`
